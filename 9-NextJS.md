# Why Nextjs ?

The biggest shift or difference between **React.js** and **Next.js** lies in their **core architecture and use cases**:

### **1. React.js is a UI Library, Next.js is a Full Framework**
   - **React.js** is primarily a **client-side JavaScript library** for building dynamic user interfaces. It focuses on component-based UI development but leaves routing, SSR, and other features to third-party libraries.
   - **Next.js** is a **full-fledged React framework** that extends React with built-in features like:
     - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
     - Static Site Generation (SSG)
     - API routes (backend-like functionality)
     - File-based routing
     - Built-in optimizations (Image, Font, Script optimizations)

### **2. Rendering Approach**
   - **React.js** mostly uses **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** by default, meaning the browser downloads a minimal HTML file and renders everything via JavaScript.
   - **Next.js** supports multiple rendering methods:
     - **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** â†’ Rendered on the server per request.
     - **SSG (Static Site Generation)** â†’ Pre-rendered at build time (faster, SEO-friendly).
     - **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** â†’ Updates static content periodically.
     - **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** â†’ Still possible but not the default.

### **3. Routing System**
   - **React.js** requires external libraries (like `react-router-dom`) for routing.
   - **Next.js** has **file-system-based routing** (just create a file in `/pages` or `/app` in Next.js 13+).

### **4. Backend Capabilities**
   - **React.js** is frontend-only; you need a separate backend (Node.js, Express, etc.).
   - **Next.js** includes **API routes** (`/pages/api` or `/app/api`), allowing you to write backend logic directly in your app.

### **5. SEO & Performance**
   - **React (CSR)** can suffer from poor SEO since search engines may struggle with JavaScript-heavy pages.
   - **Next.js (SSR/SSG)** delivers pre-rendered HTML, improving SEO and performance.

### **When to Use Which?**
- Use **React.js** if:
  - You need a single-page application (SPA).
  - You want full control over your setup (e.g., custom Webpack config).
- Use **Next.js** if:
  - You need SEO optimization (blogs, e-commerce).
  - You want built-in routing, SSR, SSG, or API routes.
  - You're building a full-stack app with React.

### **Summary**
The biggest shift is that **Next.js takes React and adds a full-stack, production-ready framework** with server-side capabilities, whereas React alone is just the UI layer. If React is the engine, Next.js is the entire car. ðŸš€

# Installation

In ReactJS, you might use vite/cra to set up a project, then add libraries for routing or styling. But Next.js provides a single command to create a project with everything you need.

In React, you needed to scaffold the project using `npm create` command, and then install scaffolded dependencies using `npm install`. But in Next, you simply execute the CNA CLI using `npx` to scaffold + install (much like shadcn/ui)

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```
# Routing

## Basic Routing

In Reactjs, you used [React Router](4-React.md/#7-routing) to define routes in a Router component, mapping paths to components. But in Next.js there is page-based routing, and Routes are `automatically` created by adding files to the `/pages` directory (Page Based Routing). For example, `/pages/about.js` becomes `/about` route.

Similarly for App Based Routing (new), the `/app/about/page.tsx` becomes `/about` route.

## Navigation

Remember that in Reactjs, we [preferred](./4-React.md#8-navigation) to use `<Link>` from the react-router-dom instead of `<a>` for linking to internal paths because it kept track of browsing history and also enabled client-side routing, updating only the parts of the page that need to change, rather than the whole page reload. See this example:

```js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const MyComponent = () => (
    <Link to="/about">Go to About Page</Link>
);
```

Next.js also uses a similar `<Link>` but additionally pre-fetches the linked page in the background so when a user clicks the link, the page loads almost instantly.

NB. `<Link to='/about'>` and `<Link href='/about'>` do the same thing.


## Dynamic Routing

In Reactjs, you can use React Router to define an /:id route linking to a Template component. Then within Template.js, you can create a template. This routing and injection of any dynamic content (eg. from the params data extracted using useParams()) takes place during run-time at the client side. As learnt earlier, you can do SSR for nearly all content in React, but dynamic content like this one still happens in client side.

In Nextjs, you can even pre-render this dynamic content using SSG. Here's how:

- Create a file `[id].js` inside the /pages directory of your project. This will automatically do routing. This automatically creates a dynamic route `/:id`.

  If you use App Router instead of the Pages Router, then for instance when you place a `page.jsx` file in `/app/apps/[id]/`, Next.js automatically recognizes it as the component to render for any URL matching `/apps/[some-id]`. So you don't need to explicitly call the component in the React style.

- Create a component file `Template.js` inside the /components directory of your project.

- Add 3 main parts in the [id].js file:
    1. Define the async `getStaticPaths()` function to pre-render all possible paths localhost:5173/id.
    2. Define the async `getStaticProps({params})` function to create some `appData` from the url params (nb. this is similar to the useParams() function in Reactjs).
    3. Define the export default function say `DynamicPage({appData})` which returns `<Template content={appData.content} />`

- In the `Template.js` file, create your Template component like this:

```js
const Template = ({ content }) => {
  return (..use {content} here..)
}
```

So here we utilize the params in before build. But Nextjs also allows utilizing params in client-side during run time, using the `useRouter` hook. For example, if you had a URL like `/posts/1?category=tech`, then :

```js
// pages/posts/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Post() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id, category } = router.query; // Accessing both id and category

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Post</h1>
      <p>This is a blog post with ID: {id}</p>
      <p>Category: {category}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```
Similarly you can use the Next Router to navigate to dynamic routes, which `<Link>` can't do. Eg.:
```js
router.push(`/apps/${data.id}`);
```

## Serverless functions

Nextjs supports two types of route files : UI & API:

1. `page.tsx`: Used for UI pages. If you want a route to render a React component (i.e., a web page), you create a page.tsx file inside a folder that represents the route segment. For example, `/app/about/page.tsx` becomes `/about` in your app.

2. `route.ts`: Used for API routes (serverless functions). If you want a route to handle API requests (like POST, GET, etc.), you create a route.ts file inside the relevant folder. For example, `/app/api/chat/route.ts` becomes `/api/chat` as an API endpoint.

Thus Nextjs serverless functions omit the need for a separate backend server.

In Nextjs, App Routerâ€™s equivalent of API routes (eg. app.post() in Expressjs) are called `Route Handlers`. You define them by `exporting` async functions named after HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, etc.) in a route.ts file.

Their standard format is :

```jsx
export async function HTTP-Method(req: Request) {
  // ...your logic
}
```
For example:
```tsx
// app/api/hello/route.ts

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // You can access request.url, request.headers, etc.
  return new Response('Hello from Next.js App Router!');
}
```
The above function uses the globally available Web `Request` and `Response` APIs. It can be accessed at the /api/hello endpoint using cURL, Postman or using async/await with the Fetch API inside a Server Component like this:

```jsx
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/hello');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
````

Common Nextjs Endpoints/Route handlers you may create are:

| Use Case              | Example Code/Description                                                                 | Endpoint Example             |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Hello World API       | Returns A Simple JSON Response                                                           | /api/hello                   |
| Database Query        | Fetches Data From A Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) And Returns It As JSON          | /api/products                |
| Authentication        | Handles User Login And JWT Token Issuance                                                | /api/login                   |
| Third-Party API Proxy | Receives A Request, Calls An External API (e.g., OpenAI, Stripe), And Returns The Result | /api/chat(like Your Example) |
| Form Submission       | Receives Form Data From The Frontend, Processes It (e.g., Sends An Email), And Responds  | /api/contact                 |


# App Router

Unlike React, Nextjs supports file-based routing. Pages Router is the traditional way and App Router the new way to do file-based routing. You have already seen previously the difference in structures of the App Router & Pages Router. You get to choose one of these at the time of creating your project using `create-next-app`.

## Fetch API Calls within async/await blocks

Pages Router is Client-heavy by default. For server tasks like `fetch api`, special data-fetching functions like `getServerSideProps` (SSR)/`getStaticProps` (SSG) respectively, i.e. export an async function called getServerSideProps/getStaticProps from a page. Any `fetch` has to be done from within them. But in App Router, by default, files in the `app/` directory are treated as `React Server Components`. This means you can export your page component itself as an `async` function and fetch data directly inside them. The server executes these functions, fetches the data, and sends the rendered HTML to the client. For interactivity possible only in client-side viz. hooks, states, you can add `'use client'` at the top of the page code.

Fetch API calls are preferred to be coded in RSCs, and since RSCs run on the server, you can run it at build time (SSG) or request-time (SSR) which makes it fast + eleiminates the need of intermediate SDKs within Expressjs endpoints, since Nextjs guarantees thereâ€™s no risk of exposing secrets or private logic to the client. This is an advantage over React/Express stack.

To ensure SSR happens instead of SSG, you can simply add a `cache` propert like this:

```js
const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user', { cache: 'no-store' });
```

Also by adding a `revalidate` parameter just before the async block, you can cause ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).

```js
export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour
```

Thus the page is statically generated, but Next.js will revalidate and update the page every hour

## Route Handlers as frontend substitutes of REST APIs

Earlier you would have defined a Nodejs endpoint like

```js
//backend/index.js
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const { name } = req.body;
  res.json({ name });
});
```
In Nextjs the corresponding Route Handler would look like

```js
// app/api/users/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { name } = await request.json();
  return Response.json({name });
}
```

Thus it eliminates the need for a separate backend server in simple scenarios.

Notice that in Expressjs, we have `req` and `res` objects and the REST endpoint produces a `res` object automatically. It sends the response using `res.json(data)` or `res.send()`. But in modern frameworks like Nextjs, we have the standard Web API's `Request` and `Response` objects, which is part of the Fetch API. You create response using `new Response(body, options)` and can return this. Or as a shortcut in Nextjs, you can `return Response.json(...)`

## Nested Layouts
`Nested layouts` is one of the distinguishing features of App Router. It allows you to create a layout that is shared across multiple pages. This is useful for creating a consistent look and feel across your application. To create a nested layout, you can create a `layout.tsx` file in the `app/` directory. The layout file will be automatically applied to all nested children. This is impossible in the Pages Router unless you manually wrap each child page with the Layout component, making your codebase clunky with this wrapping boilerplate.

## Loading.js

App Router automated the Suspense/Streaming feature of Nextjs. Let me explain.

In Pages Router, Nextjs created faster loading cf. Reactjs using Reactjs. React relied on pure async/await blocks that awaited the entire page load in case the fetched api block is slow to fetch. Consider this:

```js
export default async function Page() {
  // All components must finish fetching data before any HTML is sent to the client
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <UserProfile />
      <AnalyticsChart />
      <NotificationsFeed />
    </div>
  );
}
```
If say `AnalyticsChart` is slow to fetch data, the whole page waits.The browser sees a blank screen until everything is ready.

Enter Suspense/Streaming. This breaks the page into several components each loading parallely rather than serially. If you suspect a component's too heavy too load fast, you can wrap it in `<Suspense>` tags. For example:

```js
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {/* UserProfile is fast, so we render it directly */}
      <UserProfile />

      {/* AnalyticsChart might be slow, so we wrap it in Suspense */}
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingChart />}>
        <AnalyticsChart />
      </Suspense>

      {/* NotificationsFeed might also be slow */}
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingFeed />}>
        <NotificationsFeed />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The entire page appears to `stream`. That's why it's called Streaming.

Now enters App Router. Here when you add a `loading.js` file to a route segment in the `app/` directory, Next.js automatically wraps that segment in a Suspense boundary and uses your loading.js as the fallback UI. Cool, isn't it. Not the traditional SSR !

## Selective hydration

A webpage may contain client components as well as server components. The main component of the page itself is usually a server component. Now just like Suspense/Streaming prioritises  HTML of which UI components will be streamed from the server to client, Selective Hydration prioritises which client components will be hydrated on the client.

Traditionally the whole page waits for all JavaScript to load and then hydrates everything at once. But now React/Nextjs automatically detects the component with which the user is interacting (eg. button click) in real time, and hydrates that first.

Also, while `Suspense` is usually used for Server components which fetch data, Selective hydration only applies to client components (those with interactivity).

(Note that with Server Components (RSCs), the quantum of JS needed to be executed in the client was already reduced)


# Tussle between client components & server components

In traditional Reactjs, all components invariably render on the client. After all, that was why the MERN stack succeeded over the outdated SSR type LAMP Stack.

Vercel enginerers didn't just dispense with a separate Expressjs backend server by incorporating Route handlers (substitutes for Nodejs API endpoints) within the `/app/api` folder of the frontend; but they also found out that only the JS hydration (for interactive components) needs to be run on the client whilst the async/await fetching can happen on servers. Thus was born the concept of client components and server components (RSCs) in frontend dev.  

We have seen how all components in the Nextjs/AppRouter are RSCs by default allowing`async/await` functions. It also allows to offload as much work as possible to the Nextjs server-side and minimise the hydration payload of the browser/client. 

But practically, I faced the following problems:

---

- **PROBLEM 1**

For components which require interactivity (eg. state, effects, event handlers), we can make them client components running on the client/browser by writing `"use client"` at the top of the file. **But what if we want both async/await & interactivity in the same file?** There's the problem. 

If at all you try to put both in the same file, it will become a client component ofc, but your browser/client will try to make async calls like a server and will keep re-rendering the page, heating up your computer. Further, with "use client", Next.js will send a fat JavaScript bundle to the browser to hydrate the whole page, even for static parts like say the nav or welcome message. 

- **SOLUTION 1: SEPARATION**

The solution is to take out the interactive apsects into a separate client component file say `/components/MyClientComponent.tsx` and then import it to your RSC say `/app/MyRSC.tsx` using `import MyClientComponent from "@/components/MyClientComponent.tsx";`

---

- **PROBLEM 2**

If you have a **highly** interactive component, eg an autosuggest search bar or a live score updates widget, it has to be a client component but there's high likelihood that its constantly fetching realtime data/debounced data from a server/endpoint/database. Would you then start fetch in client component again? No !!!

- **SOLUTION 2: SERVER ACTIONS**

Here you keep all fetching code in a file say `/server/actions/myServerAction.ts` and all interactive code in a file say `/components/client-comps/interactive.ts`. Then you can import your server action in your client component like: `import { myServerAction } from "@/server/actions/myServerAction";` and use it to fetch data like this : `const data = await myServerAction(query);` within an async function.

Note that although it appears to be the same old async/await which was meant to be forbidden inside a client component, there are differences :

> 1- The actual fetch compute is happening in the server through server actions. The aysnc/await in the client component is a bare minimum necessity. The client/user interaction triggers the action (e.g., via a form or function call), but the server does the work. The client-side JS is quite minimised. 

> 2- The api endpoint is not exposed in the client/browser. Hence it's secure.

Note that you must declare `"use server"` directive at the top of a server actions file.

Server actions are not components. They are exprtable async functions that run on the server, which can be called as props like callback functions and also in forms, event listeners, etc. A server action file (say /server/actions/create.ts) would look like this:
```ts
'use server'
export async function create() {
  // Server-side logic
}
```






# My project organisation style

In React, a function that returns JSX that partly/wholly describes what should appear on the UI is called a `functional component`. A function with no jsx return block is called a `regular function`. 

My philosphy (and something I can add as system-prompt during vibe-coding) is as follows:

1. Use the "islands architecture" - keep most components server-rendered, and only make interactive parts client components. 

2. In the `/app` folder, one `page.tsx` file should define only one `functional component` which should be marked `export default` and preferably in `arrow syntax` (it can import other func components from other files for nested rendering and ofc define many regular functions within the default func component).

3. By default, all my top-level React Server Components (RSCs) will be mounted on routes. For that I will divide my `/app` folder into subfolders say `/RSC1`, `/RSC2`, etc. each with nested folders or just a `page.tsx` file. Each of them will be accessible by hrefing to the route say `/RSC2/bookmarks/`, etc.

4. For all other components, I will make 2 sub-folders inside the `/components` folder: `/client-comps` and `/server-comps` **exclusively** for `client components` (requiring interactivity like state, hooks, event handlers, etc) and `server components` (requiring async/await or fetch) **respectively**. These components can be imported into my top-level RSCs in the `/app` folder. 

5. For **highly** interactive client components like an autosuggest search bar or a live score updates widget, anywhere in my project, the fetch logic from a database/api through an api endpoint/ route handler in my `/app/api` will be **replaced** with calling a server action from within a `useEffect` hook body. This corresponding server action will be stored in a file in the `/server/actions` folder and will be doing the actual server-side fetching logic.


## ILLUSTRATION

To illustrate the islands architecture, consider that I want to authenticate a user's session, then fetch all bookmarks from a database table and display them with some interactivity (eg. button to delete bookmark from database). For this I will use 3 files:

1. `Server Action (getBookmarks):` Encapsulates all DB logic, reusable from anywhere.

2. `Client Component (BookmarkTableClient.js):` Handles all browser interactivity, state, and UI updates.

3. `Server Component (page.js):` Handles authentication, calls server action, and passes data to the client.

So the Server Component may be a minimal file like this:

```ts
// app/bookmarks/page.js
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import { getBookmarks } from "@/actions/getBookmarks";
import BookmarkTableClient from "./BookmarkTableClient";

export default async function BookmarksPage() {
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session) redirect("/");

  const userEmail = session.user?.email;
  if (!userEmail) return <div className="p-8">User not found.</div>;

   const bookmarks = await getBookmarks(session.user.id); //calling server action

     return (
    <main className="max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-10 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Bookmarked Profiles</h2>
      <BookmarkTableClient initialBookmarks={bookmarks} /> 
    </main>
  );
}
```
As clear, the server component offloads the heavylifting to the server action and client components.

Note that it's also possible to directly use the server action to handle an event within the client component, eg. Button onclick or in the `action` attribute of a `<form>`. But I don't prefer this for the sake of modularity. I would rather import the server action in the high-level RSC and pass it as props to the client component there.


# Vercel's AI SDK

`npm install ai`

Then to install say the Vercel's OpenAI SDK: `npm install @ai-sdk/openai`

In Next.js 13+, files are Server Components by default. If you need interactivity (hooks, event handlers), you must mark the file as `'use client'`

THe most standard frontend UI code is:

```tsx
//frontend/app/page.tsx

'use client';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function GeneratePage() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [response, setResponse] = useState('');

  // Explicit fetch-based submission
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/generate', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: input }),
    });
    const { result } = await res.json();
    setResponse(result);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        value={input}
        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
      <div>{response}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

But you can use Vercel's AI SDK to substitute this simple fetch call as follows:

1. **Vercel's useChat hook (Recommended for Chats)**
```tsx
'use client';
import { useChat } from 'ai/react'; // Vercel's pre-built hook

export default function ChatPage() {
  // useChat handles submission AND streaming automatically. No need to explicitly define handleSubmit function
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    api: '/api/chat' // Points to your streaming API route
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map(m => (
        <div key={m.id}>{m.role}: {m.content}</div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that you must use Vercel's `streamText` function in the API Route when you use `useChat` in the frontend.

2. **Vercel's useActions hook (Advanced Interactive UIs)**

The `useActions` hook is more flexible than `useChat` and is ideal when you need multiple AI actions or complex UI interactions. Here's how to use it:

```tsx
'use client';
import { useActions } from 'ai/react';

export default function AIActionsPage() {
  const { complete, isLoading } = useActions({
    api: '/api/ai/actions'
  });

  // You can define multiple AI actions
  const handleTranslate = async () => {
    const response = await complete('translate', {
      text: 'Hello world',
      targetLanguage: 'Spanish'
    });
    console.log(response.text); // "Hola mundo"
  };

  const handleSummarize = async () => {
    const response = await complete('summarize', {
      text: 'Long article content...'
    });
    console.log(response.summary);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={handleTranslate}
        disabled={isLoading}
      >
        Translate Text
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={handleSummarize}
        disabled={isLoading}
      >
        Summarize Text
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
