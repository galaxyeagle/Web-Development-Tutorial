    "# Introduction to JavaScript\n",
    "Before even starting to learn JavaScript, I made my hands dirty with HTML and CSS. The best way to do that for a newbie is to head to [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) and start practicing the basics in its online compiler. Once you gain a bit of confidence, go to any text editor in your PC/Mac (say Notepad) and start writing the same code there. Then save it as a filename.html file and double-click on the file in your folder to open it in your default browser (Chrome for me, but Firefox is also great). Later I switched to Sublime Text and then to VSCode as my code editor.\n",
    "After sufficient practice in HTML and CSS, I tried going over to JS. There are many cool projects in JS that I will be telling alongwith associated concepts. So its gonna be a great learning experience.But before that, lets understand a few concepts. For a more holistic understanding of Javascript first as an OOP and then as an in-browser language, you can refer to [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) later.   \n",
    "NB. : The hyperlinked text matter you'll see all along is optional. You can click & read them for conceptual clarity if needed. Beginners should surely read them."

    "## 1. Constructor functions\n",
    "I hope you know what functions/methods are, how they are defined and how they are called. You must have seen the `\"new\"` operator during [function call/object creation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.3?topic=operators-function-call-expressions)? But have you ever seen the `\"this\"` keyword inside [function definition](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/xl-c-and-cpp-aix/16.1?topic=functions-function-declarations-definitions)? Well such a weird function is called a \"constructor\" function. It is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize objects. By convention, constructor function names start with an uppercase letter. Consider the below example where `Person` is a constructor function that initializes `name` and `age` properties and the `greet` method, where `this` refers to the context of this constructor function that is assigned to any object created during function call:"

    "Compare the `class-based syntax` for `constructer creation` vs the earlier `function-based syntax`. What's the difference you observe? Firstly there's no difference in the syntax for `creating an instance`. The difference is in `constructer creation`. A class as usual contains several methods defined on the prototype of the class. The attributes contexed by the `this` keyword are enclosed in a special `constructer` method whilst `greet` and any other method are defined without the `this` keyword, which means they are shared among all instances. This approach is more memory-efficient since thereâ€™s only one copy of the method. That's why developers often prefer class syntax for constructers."

    "# Document Object Model (DOM)\n",
    "\n",
    "DOM is the representation of the webpage as tree of elements, supported by modern HTML.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/DOM-model.svg\" style= \"float:left; margin-right:20px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As is evident from the figure, there is a hierarchy of `elements` starting from `document` to `<html>` to `<head>` and `<body>` to `<title>` and so on. The `document` element is like the entire DOM tree! The `<html>` element is the root element and is like the trunk of the tree. Other tags are like branches, and finally the text or img becomes the end leaf ! Each tag can have several HTML attributes as you already know. **The best thing is that each element/node is treated as an `object` making DOM a tree of objects** with each object denoting a different section of the webpage content. The JavaScript language, invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, allowed `manipulation` of this DOM tree *__(using the trio of <a id=\"domm\"></a> 1. fetching elements, 2. listening to events, 3. handling events)__*. This DOM manipulation  reflects the the user's ability to interact with the DOM tree objects and their attributes & methods to change the content and structure of the document dynamically at the client-side using user-generated `events` like clicks, hovers, keyboard inputs, etc. This literally created a revolution enabling dynamic and interactive web experiences beyond static HTML. It started with responsive buttons and drop-down menus but quickly expanded to Google forms, interactive UI, browser-based games and data viz (eg. D3js). In 2009, Node.js library was invented by Ryan Dahl which allowed JavaScript to be used outside of the web browser to write server-side applications (backend dev), making it a popular choice for building desktop and mobile applications as well. I will later ride you through exciting projects about both creating client-side UI (using jQuery, Lodash, Bootstrap, Chart.js, etc.) as well as server-side apps (using React, Angular, Vue.js libraries). But lets strengthen our remaining fundamentals first.  \n",
    "Lets understand how the above trio of DOM Manipulation can be achieved. We now know that DOM is a tree of objects and objects are instances of classes. JavaScript has an inbuilt DOM API which has several useful classes. Each class has useful attributes and methods which you can invoke to manipulate the behaviour of DOM objects. DOM objects are automatically inherited from their parent Class without requiring any instantiation by you. Cool, isn't it? So lets look at some of these useful classes and their main attributes & functions in the next section."

Such classes may be linked to different CSS properties. This allows us to create cool animations. Check out my simple box animation example [here](https://codepen.io/galaxyeagle/pen/VYZxayq). In this example, we `addEventListener` to the `keydown` and `keyup` events and if `event.code` matches KeyA it adds/removes our custom  .animation class to the box element. Note that the `transition` CSS property in the parent class allows us to put transition effects like delay for `all` or selected properties of the added class.

    "By now you must have got the taste of JavaScript ! Before you get into more complex and fun projects, lets be clear about the different tools & environments you can work on. I'll share my own journey so that its not uncharted for you :) \n",
    "\n",
    "1. As I said in the beginning, I started simply with the Notepad. I created a single html file and put in all my CSS code within the `<style>` tag or the `style:` attribute of the concerned element, and all my JS code within a `<script>` tag. Then I double clicked my html file and it rendered in my default browser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. When CSS and JS code grew bulky, I created separate .html, .css and .js files in a folder and linked them in my html file (preferably within the `<head>` tag) using  \n",
    "`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">` and  \n",
    "`<script src=\"script.js\"></script>` respectively. Then I ran the .html file as before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next I switched to an advanced editor. Instead of Notepad, I used Sublime Text. Its lightweight and here I can have `folder view` and also open a `termainal` with [Alt+1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-terminal-in-sublime-text-editor/). Language based color coding is also available. You can open your html file and right-click on the screen and click \"Open in Browser\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next I switched to Visual Studio Code. I soon realised that its much powerful than Sublime. With the `Live Preview` extension, you can preview the main .html file of your project in real time within the editor itself (Ref. the extension documentation for guidance). You can also create very quick code snippets with the [Emmet toolkit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/write-html-css-faster-with-emmet-cheat-codes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Other tools: I also tried online tools like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). If you want to get the exact VSCode experience online without downloading VSCode Desktop, you can try `Github Codespace` (has preinstalled Git) or `vscode.dev` which run on cloud-based virtual machines. You can create a Jupyter Notebook (either in VSCode, Jupyter lab or remote-hosted Juputer notebook using Anaconda) with the deno kernel and run JS there: infact that's how this notebook is created. You can also code and debug in the `DevTools` of your browser. Finally you can use a runtime like `nodejs` or `deno` to run your js code exclusively without any html file. `Devtools` and `nodejs` is actually quite important but a little more detailed. I'll take that them up later.\n"
